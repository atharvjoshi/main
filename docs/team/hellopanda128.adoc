== PROJECT: IncidentManager

'''

== Overview

The Incident Management System is a desktop application used for managing incidents. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* Major enhancement: Vehicle Management
** What it does: Allows the user to add, edit and delete vehicles from the incident management system
** Justification: This feature allows the system to match the needs of the target user more closely. Since the product is a Incident Management System, it makes sense to model real world situations where vehicles can be worn out and retired or bought and added.
** Highlights: Certain commands have added restrictions to prevent user mistakes. For example, vehicle can only be deleted if it is not a dispatched vehicle.


* Minor enhancement: morphed `EditCommand` to edit incidents.
** Summary: Implemented EditIncidentCommand through morphing EditCommand from AddressBook-Level 3.

* Minor enhancement: implemented `Incident` model
** Summary: Created the `Incident` model that simulates an incident report.
** Highlight: A unique ID for the incident report is autogenerated for every instance of a new report. This is facilitated by the `IncidentId` class.
