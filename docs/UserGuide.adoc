== Introduction

The Incident Management System (IMS) is a desktop app made for emergency call operators for coordinating emergency vehicle dispatch and incident report generation. IMS is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The streamlined workflow of the IMS is designed to enable call operators to dispatch vehicles and prepare reports without wasting any precious time. That's because, in an emergency, every second counts.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ims.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Incident Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  You will first need to `register` an account, or `login` with one of the pre-made accounts.
.  Logging in with an account that has the `Admin` tag (e.g. Agent01) gives you admin access to the system. The default password is 'password'.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
(TODO)
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Some commands have admin restrictions. Admins accounts are identified by the `Admin` tag.
====

[NOTE]
An account with admin privileges is included in the sample data with `Username` *Agent01* and `Password` *password*

=== Viewing help : `help`
Format: `help`

// tag::access[]
=== Logging in: `login`

Logs the user into the IMS and registers the active session. +

[NOTE]
The only commands available prior to login are `Register`, `Login`, `Help`, and `Exit`.

Example:

* `login u/Agent01 w/password`

=== Logging out: `logout`

Logs the user out of the IMS and closes the user's session. +
Format: `logout`

Account Management Interface:

image::account.png[width="500"]

// end::access[]

// tag::account[]
=== Registering an account: `register`

Registers an account into the Incident Management System +
Format: `register n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL u/USERNAME w/PASSWORD [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A account can have any number of tags (including 0). Only logged-in admins can add tags.

****
* Usernames must be at least 3 characters in length and must be unique.
* Usernames can only consist of alphanumeric characters and the following special characters, excluding the parentheses, (.-)
* Usernames cannot begin or end with a non alphanumeric character.
* Usernames and Passwords cannot be blank or contain a whitespace.
* Passwords must be at least 6 characters in length.
* Passwords can only contain alphanumeric characters and/or these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (!#$%&'*+/=?`{|}~^.-)
****

Examples:

* `register n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com u/op1 w/password`
* If logged in with an admin account: +
`register n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com u/oc1 w/password p/1234567 t/Team-1-OC`

=== Updating an account : `update`

Updates an existing account in the incident Manager or the own account of the user logged in if the index is left empty. +
Format: `update [INDEX] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [u/USERNAME] [w/PASSWORD] [t/TAG]...`

[NOTE]
Only admins can update other user accounts. Non-admins cannot specify an index when executing the update command.

****
* If an index is not provided, update executes on the account of the user logged in.
* If an index is provided, updates the account at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed account list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When updating tags, the existing tags of the account will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* Only admins can access and edit tags. Admins cannot remove their own admin tag.
* You can remove all the account's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `update p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
updates the phone number and email address of the logged in account to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `update 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
updates the name of the 2nd account to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

==== Incident Auto Update `[coming in v2.0]`

Any updates to user account details will search for all incidents created by the account and update those references as well.

=== Listing accounts : `list-a`

Shows a list of all accounts registered in the incident Manager or those whose tags match any of the keywords if a keyword is specified. +
Format: `list-a [KEYWORD] [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `admin` will match `Admin`
* Only the account tags are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `ad` will not match `admin`
* Accounts matching all keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
****

Examples:

* `list-a` +
Displays the entire list of accounts
* `list-a team-1 admin` +
Returns a list of all accounts that have both the `admin` and `team-1` tag

=== Locating accounts by name or username: `find-a`

Finds accounts whose name or username contains any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find-a KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name and username is searched.
* Only full words will be matched for Names e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Partial words will be matched for Usernames e.g. `Agent` will match `Agent01`
* Accounts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find-a John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find-a Agent01 Betty`
Returns all accounts with username or name matching either `agent01` or `betty`

=== Deleting an account : `delete-a`

Deletes the specified account from the incident Manager. +
Format: `delete-a INDEX`

****
* Deletes the account at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed account list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

[NOTE]
Only admins can access the delete command. You cannot delete your own account.

Examples:

* `list-a` +
`delete-a 2` +
Deletes the 2nd account in the Incident Manager.
* `find-a Agent01` +
`delete-a 1` +
Deletes the 1st account in the results of the `find` command.

==== Incident Auto Update `[coming in v2.0]`

Deleting a user will search for all incidents created by the user and place a `deleted` flag next to the account details.
// end::account[]

// tag::new[]
=== Create New Incident: `new`

This command works in two ways:

*1. auto/Y* +
Format: `new dist/DISTRICT auto/Y`

****
* An available vehicle in the given district will be automatically dispatched to the incident site.
** If no vehicle is available, the vehicle pane will be blank, and a relevant message is displayed.
* After the new incident is successfully created, the vehicle pane will show all vehicles in the given district.
** The draft incident only has three fields filled: operator, district and vehicle dispatched.
****

[IMPORTANT]
Valid district numbers are from 1 to 28!

* Example usage:

image::newCommandAutoYBeforeSS.png[]

* Expected outcome: In this case, there is no vehicle available in district 1.

image::newCommandAutoYAfterSS.png[]

*2. auto/N* +
Format: `new dist/DISTRICT auto/N`

****
* A list of available vehicles in the given district will be shown.
* A message will also appear to prompt user to also include the index of the chosen vehicle.
** If no vehicle is available, the vehicle pane will be blank, and a relevant message is displayed.
* After the new incident is successfully created, the vehicle pane will show all vehicles in the given district.
****

* Example usage:

image::newCommandAutoNPromptSS.png[]

image::newCommandAutoNAfterPromptSS.png[]

image::newCommandAutoNAfterSS.png[]

[NOTE]
If multiple flags of the same prefix is provided by user, the command will take the last valid parameter of each prefix. +
For example `new dist/1 dist/2 dist/3 auto/Y auto/N` is equivalent to `new dist/3 auto/N`. +
Rationale: user need not waste time backspacing if an input was keyed in wrongly.

[IMPORTANT]
For manual dispatchment of vehicle, the index of the chosen vehicle must be from the list of vehicles available in the given district, which is only displayed when `new dist/DISTRICT auto/N` is used.
// end::new[]


// tag::fill[]
=== Filling a draft incident report: `fill`
Fills a draft incident report if relevant parameters are specified, otherwise lists all draft reports ready for filling.

This command works in two modes:

****
*1. No parameter mode* +
Format: `fill` +
Lists all draft incident reports ready to be filled.

* This command lists both incomplete and complete drafts.
* If no drafts exist, a message is displayed and the Incident list remains unchanged.
****

* Outcome of `fill`:

image::fillCommandNoParamsAfterScreenshot.png[width="500"]

****
*2. Parameter mode* +
Format: `fill [INDEX] [p/CALLER_NUMBER] [desc/DESCRIPTION]` +
Fills the draft incident report corresponding to the specified index with the phone number of the caller who reported the incident and the description of the incident.

[NOTE]
The user can only fill the draft incident reports that have been created by them.

* Index must be assigned *with reference to the currently shown list of incidents* on the GUI incident panel.
* Both incomplete and complete drafts can be filled.
* Fields of complete drafts will be overwritten.
* Executing this command changes incident `status` to 'Complete Draft'.
* Both `CALLER_NUMBER` and `DESCRIPTION` fields must be specified while executing this command.
* The newly filled draft will now appear at the top of the list of incidents in the GUI incident panel view.
****

* Outcome of `fill 1 p/90309049 desc/Traffic accident reported at FKU hospital junction`:

image::fillCommandWithParamsAfterScreenshot.png[width="500"]

Using `fill` in both modes one after the other thus enables convenient listing and filling of target incident reports.

// end::fill[]

// tag::submit[]
=== Submitting a completed draft report: `submit`
Submits a completed draft incident report if relevant parameters are specified, otherwise lists all completed drafts ready for submission.

Similar to `fill`, this command also works in two modes:

****
*1. No parameter mode* +
Format: `submit` +
Lists all completed draft incident reports ready for submission.

* This command only lists complete drafts.
* If no complete drafts exist, a message is displayed and the Incident list remains unchanged.
****

* Outcome of `submit`

image::submitCommandNoParamsAfterScreenshot.png[width="500"]

****
*2. Parameter mode* +
Format: `submit [INDEX]` +
Submits the completed draft incident report corresponding to the specified index.

[NOTE]
The user can only submit the completed incident reports that have been created by them.

* Index must be assigned *with reference to the currently shown list of incidents* on the GUI incident panel.
* Only complete drafts can be submitted.
* Executing this command changes incident `status` to `SUBMITTED_REPORT`.
* The newly submitted draft will now appear at the top of the list of incidents in the GUI incident panel view.
****

* Outcome of `submit 1`:

image::submitCommandWithParamsAfterScreenshot.png[width="500"]

// end::submit[]

// tag::adminaccessfillsubmit[]
=== Admins can fill and submit drafts `[coming in v2.0]`
****
This feature will allow admins to fill and submit incomplete and complete drafts, in case the operator that created those reports has been now removed from the system.
****
// end::adminaccessfillsubmit[]

// tag::incidentversionhistory[]
=== Tracking incident history `[coming in v2.0]`
****
Allows user to track any changes made to an incident report throughout its lifecycle in the incident management system. +
Format: `track [INDEX]` +
Function: Outputs a list of timestamps and a brief summary of changes made to the specified incident report.

This feature will allow the user to improve accountability in filing incident reports. As the IMS handles incident data which is very sensitive in nature, it will be crucial for users to know when exactly were what changes made to a given incident report.
****
// end::incidentversionhistory[]

// tag::listi[]
=== Listing all incidents: `list-i`
Shows a list of all incidents in the Incident Manager +
Format: `list-i`

Example usage and expected outcome:

image::listIncidentsCommand.png[]
.Fig X. The `list-i` command returns all incidents within the system.

* The listing returns all incidents, inclusive of all incomplete drafts and complete drafts and submitted incident reports
* Adding any keywords or parameters will result in an error. Only `list-i` is allowed.
// end::listi[]

// tag::findi[]
=== Locating an incident report using incident ID, operator name or description keyword: `find-i`
Finds incidents containing the relevant specified parameters.
Possible Parameters: `id/`, `op/`, `desc/`, `self`

*Different Parameters*

**By Operator Name** +
Format: `find-i op/<OPERATOR KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]>` +
Lists all incidents whereby the operator name contains any of the given keywords

* Accepts multiple search terms for the parameter, searching for any match with any search term

* Example of Successful Single Operator Search and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithOperatorParameter.png[]
.Fig X. The `find-i` command has been called with one word under parameter `op\`, returning all incidents whereby the operator name matches `alex` (case-insensitive)

* Example of Successful Multiple Operator Search and Expected Outcome:

image::findIncidentsCommandWithOperatorsParameter.png[]
.Fig X. The `find-i` command has been called multiple words under parameter `op\`, returning all incidents whereby the operator name matches `irfan` or `bernice` (case-insensitive)
